## ***Flutter***

*Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for [mobile](https://flutter.dev/docs), [web](https://flutter.dev/web), and [desktop](https://flutter.dev/desktop) from a single codebase.*<br>

***Flutter** has three features.*<br>
>![Fast Development](https://flutter.dev/assets/homepage/icon-development-02b120c5632de8bcfebaa9af8d93938c403217b5be8d40d596af576c4ed85aa6.svg) Fast Development<br>
>>Paint your app to life in milliseconds with Stateful Hot Reload. Use a rich set of fully-customizable widgets to build native interfaces in minutes.

>![Expressive and Flexible UI](https://flutter.dev/assets/homepage/icon-ui-5917d09ef0d8f9538615b4281870960b865bba4c8b6926b5adaef91433af0b07.svg) Expressive and Flexible UI<br>
>>Quickly ship features with a focus on native end-user experiences. Layered architecture allows for full customization, which results in incredibly fast rendering and expressive and flexible designs.

>![Native Performance](https://flutter.dev/assets/homepage/icon-performance-680fb3687109ba7ea0c22627da3a9fa761944ae7b521468003b932aa9133ca5b.svg) Native Performance
>>Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts, and your Flutter code is compiled to native ARM machine code using [Dart's native compilers](https://dart.dev/overview#platform).
